# Course Management System – Java Desktop Application
**Course Management System** is a desktop application developed using Java and MySQL to simplify academic operations such as course registration, user management, and academic data handling. The project demonstrates strong object-oriented programming (OOP) practices including inheritance, encapsulation, and modular design to ensure maintainability and scalability.

This system features role-based access and secure, user-specific dashboards for Admins, Teachers, and Students.

## Features
- Role-Based Access Control: Custom dashboards and access rights for Admins, Teachers, and Students.
- Secure Authentication System: Login functionality with validation and session management.
- CRUD Functionalities: Admins can manage users and courses. Teachers can manage course materials and grades. Students can view and register for courses.
- Relational Database Integration: MySQL database with 7+ tables managing academic entities like users, courses, departments, grades, and more.
- OOP Principles Applied: Clear implementation of inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and modularity.
- Desktop GUI: User-friendly desktop interface designed using Java Swing.

## Technologies Used
- Java (OOP) – Core language for backend logic and GUI
- MySQL – Relational database management system
- JDBC – Java Database Connectivity for MySQL integration
- Java Swing – For creating desktop UI (if used)
